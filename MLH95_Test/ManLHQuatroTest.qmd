## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

print('hello Quatro')
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| include: false
2 * 2
```

The mean of 1 and 2 and 3 is `r mean(c(1,2,3))`.

```{r}
x <- 5 #radius of a circle
```
For a circle with the radius `r x`,
its area is `r pi * x^2`.

Note for self: if the eval is set to FALSE, this calculation wouldn't work.

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
